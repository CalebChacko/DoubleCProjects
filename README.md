#### Introduction 

In a grocery store with a thriving night-life, what Can would want to leave? Certainly not Canny! Sadly, recently the grocery store got sued for leaving expired food out for customers to purchase. Due to these events, management has changed! Now before closing time, employees check every item’s best before date. In order to stay and enjoy the bustling environment of the grocery store, you must find spare change at night to purchase new labels with new best before days from the black bean market. The more money you collect, the longer your stay.

However, it won’t be easy. You are not the only one trying to survive, other food products need to survive too!

The collected change stays in your can during the day. The more you collect the more noise you make, the harder it is to hide from employees. Do you risk staying longer???

If you collect enough change you stay, if not...SOLD!
